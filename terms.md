# Scope

This license covers contributions the _Seller_ made to the _Project_ with the _Identifier_ in metadata, and any contributions the _Seller_ makes to the _Project_ in the future without changing the _Identifier_ or adding a new one.  This license does not cover contributions the _Seller_ makes to the project in the future with a different or additional identifier.

# Payment

All the licenses granted under these terms are conditional on payment of the _Price_, if any.

# Copyright

The _Seller_ licenses the _Buyer_ for the _Term_ to do everything with the _Contributions_ to the _Project_ that would otherwise infringe the _Seller_'s copyright in them.

# Patent

The _Seller_ licenses the _Buyer_ for the _Term_ to do everything with the project that would otherwise infringe patent claims the _Seller_ can license or becomes able to license.

# Sublicensing

If the _Buyer_ combines the _Contributions_ to the _Project_ with other software in a larger application, the _Buyer_ may sublicense the _Contributions_ as part of their larger application, and allow further sublicensing in turn, under the following rules.  The _Buyer_ may build, and sublicense for, as many larger applications as they like.

1.  The larger application must have significant additional content or functionality beyond that of the _Project_, and end users must license the larger application primarily for that added content or functionality.

2.  The _Buyer_ may not sublicense anyone to break any rule of any public license for the _Contributions_ for any changes of their own or any software besides the larger application.

3.  [No Liability](#no-liability), [Sublicensing](#sublicensing), and [Notices](#notices) must apply to each sublicense.

# Notices

# Agency

The _Seller_ has authorized the _Agent_ to sign this license on the _Seller_'s behalf.
